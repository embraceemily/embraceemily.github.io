						<p class="lead">Embrace Emily was born in 2014 with one goal in mind: to help provide financial
							support to our friend Emily as she treated her metastatic breast cancer with alternative
							therapies not covered by traditional health insurance. Her “St. George Convention,” together
							with friends and family held a huge fundraiser to raise money to get her to the Herzog
							Clinic in Nidda, Germany. With that mission accomplished, we came together again in 2016 for
							another successful event to keep her momentum going. Emily managed her diagnosis from
							2009-2017, all while building her own community of cancer warriors. Emily was passionate
							about reaching out to others enduring their own battle, offering her knowledge, her
							experiences, and her friendship.
							<br><br>
							Before Em passed in April of 2017, her best friend Ellen made her a promise to keep Embrace
							Emily going to keep her legacy alive. Embrace Emily became an official non-profit 501(c)(3)
							in April of 2018, with a mission to empower members of our community who are affected by
							breast cancer and other cancers by helping to offset costs associated with treatment.

							battling breast cancer knew she wanted to seek complementary therapies. As Embrace Emily
							was founded on the need to give Emily the means to seek out other therapies not covered by
							traditional health insurance, we knew we wanted to help. We covered two months of
							complementary therapies for this grant recipient including yoga, guided meditation, massage,
							group physical therapies, nutritional supplements, counseling, and medical cannabis. Thank
							you for helping to make this happen, Embrace Emily community! This recipient shared, "I
							have no words of gratitude to thank you enough for your help in this difficult time. Thank

							severe neuropathy, she has difficulty working, walking, and even standing for more than 5
							minutes. However, Marianne tries to be positive in her journey, and says laughter gets her
							through. Embrace Emily was able to help Marianne with a grant for copays, prescription
							costs, gas to get to and from treatments, and groceries. But she is most excited to use
							some of the grant money to try alternative methods to treat her neuropathy, including
							acupuncture. We are hopeful you are able to find some relief, Marianne!

                            At just 41, at her annual exam on May 9th, her doctor discovered a lump. A mammogram,
                            ultrasound and biopsy later, she received the call no woman could ever imagine. After
                            hearing her diagnosis on June 18, 2019, Sarah remembers thinking, “am I going to be okay,
                            will I lose my hair, what about my babies?” She had a lumpectomy on July 16th and is now
                            working on her treatment plan. Sarah is now looking for the positive every day in her “new
                            normal”. As a single mom, she is finding her time spent best with her 4 and 7 year old
                            daughters, has a great support team in her mom, friends and coworkers, and is finally
                            putting herself first. She is grateful for something every day and is determined to take
                            care of herself, making sure she is okay, to make sure her girls are okay. As Sarah says,
                            she will find the light at the end of the tunnel. The Embrace Emily Family is proud to join
                            Sarah’s support team. Sarah, we wish you good health and healing in the year ahead.

                            Because of the suspicious look of the lump on the films I was then referred for a biopsy.
                            On May 2nd, my biopsy revealed that I in fact had Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS). I was
                            lucky enough to have caught it so early being that it was only at Stage 0 and hadn’t reached
                            any of my breast tissue yet, but I had tested positive for HER2+. Because I tested positive
                            for that hormone meant that I would need chemotherapy. Yes, hearing that I needed
                            chemotherapy and that I most definitely was going to lose my hair isn’t something that I
                            wanted to hear, but the silver lining in all of this was that I was going to be okay. There
                            was a treatment for me and I was going to be okay. I elected to have a bilateral mastectomy
                            with immediate reconstruction on June 4th, 2019. The tumor was removed, and the surgery went
                            great. Since my surgery, knowing that I am going to start chemotherapy once I am healed, I
                            elected to also freeze my eggs. As if my regular doctor appointments weren’t enough, I was
                            now going through fertility treatments to save my eggs for the future. Fertility treatments
                            went as planned and I was able to freeze 18 eggs, which was great. Now, I just sit and wait
                            to start my chemotherapy treatment. <br> <br>
                            When you find out that you have cancer, your whole world immediately stops. You are at the
                            mercy of doctors, insurance, and the game of having no other option but to be patient. That
                            self-examination had saved my life. If I hadn’t even checked myself, who knows how much
                            larger the tumor could have gotten or how fast this horrible disease could have progressed.
                            I can’t imagine going through this process without the amazing support I have received from
                            my family and friends. Through this journey I really have learned to stop and smell the
                            roses once in a while, don’t take things for granted, always remain positive, and appreciate
                            all that I have in life. I have my treatment planned, I know I’m going to be okay, and I can
                            see the light at the end of the tunnel. This is just another bump in the road, but I am
                            going to be okay.</p>

	                    <h2>Em's Story:</h2>
	                    <h4>“You have breast cancer.” In 2009, at just 27 years old, Emily Klaus heard those
							life-changing words. At the time of her diagnosis Emily was doing what she loved, working at
							Easter Seals in Tinley Park teaching children with Autism. She was also working towards her
							Master’s Degree in Special Education. She put her career and education on hold, opting for a
							double mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Even after taking these most
							aggressive actions, her cancer came back more than once, and in July of 2012, Emily learned
							the cancer had metastasized to her brain and spinal column.
							<br><br>
							Below is the narrative Emily wrote in 2016 about the experiences she had after the cancer
							metastasized.
							<br><br>

	                    <div class="col-xs-1">
	                    </div>
	                    <div class="col-lg-10">
	                        <p class="lead">I was given whole brain and whole spine radiation for a little over a month.
								The brain tumor significantly shrunk, making my doctors believe it was just scar tissue
								showing up on the scans. Some of the spinal tumors shrank, but never died off. I had a
								really positive attitude with these results. Time and life went on, with three month
								check-ups and monthly shots. Everything was quiet and stable.
								<br><br>
								Then, Christmas of 2014, my scans showed that the spinal tumors were growing and new
								spots had appeared. My radiation oncologist decided that another round of whole brain
								and spine radiation was the best next step. The radiation made some improvement, but it
								wasn't close to the results we had the first time.
								<br><br>
								On July 4,2015, I woke up with severe dizziness and nausea. As the day went on, it grew
								worse. Later that evening we decided I needed to give the ER a visit. My oncologist sent
								orders for a brain MRI. At 9 PM, as fireworks filled the sky, I laid alone in the MRI
								machine. Hours later waiting for the results, the ER doctor came in with the news…five
								new tumors on the brain. Appointments were made to see my oncologist and radiologist to
								go over next steps.
								<br><br>
								Over the next few days, the dizziness stopped, but the blurry eyes started. I couldn't
								focus unless one eye was covered. The eye doctor said my vision was 20/20, but my eyes
								weren't able to work together. Now we know one of the brain tumors is on my optic nerve.
								Because of my depth perception being totally off, I have to resort to using a cane and
								walker to help with balance and walking. At that moment I lost my independence.
								<br><br>
								Since I had two whole body radiations, my oncologist started me on a pill form chemo but
								took me off of it after one dose. She sent me out to Boston in August of 2015 for a
								second opinion to make sure her next steps were the same as the doctor at Dana-Farber
								Cancer Institute in Boston. He agreed, so I headed back to Chicago and started my first
								round of IV chemo, Gemzar.
								<br><br>
								In October of 2015, my sister, who is a nurse, came into my room and said I didn't look
								good. My blood pressure was really low, I was dehydrated, and had an abnormal heart rate.
								This was my second trip to the ER, and I learned I was septic with E.Coli in my urine.
								I was admitted for seven nights. When I was released from the hospital, I took a three
								week break from chemo before I started up again. About three sessions in, after deciding
								my body has had enough, I made the most difficult decision to stop chemo and try healing
								myself with natural treatments and diets. I have a strong feeling and strong belief that
								these more natural treatments can help boost my own immune system to kill these tumors.
								<br><br>
								Unfortunately, I had yet a couple more setbacks. I developed an open wound on my heel
								that is taking months to close. I've had two grafts put on to help with the healing. So
								far it's been successful and is almost fully healed.
								<br><br>
								The second setback was the urgent removal of my left implant. I was using a heating pad
								to warm up because I am always cold; I fell asleep with it on my chest leaving a small
								burn  mark. As days went by, the burn became a blister, then an open wound. My doctor
								never addressed it nor showed concern. We kept it clean and changed the gauze everyday,
								but apparently that wasn't enough. The wound got so deep that the skin became red and
								swollen, suddenly exposing my implant. I had emergency surgery the very next morning for
								the removal of my implant.
								<br><br>
								Although my story sounds brutal, I am trying my hardest to stay strong and positive. And
								thanks to my family and my amazing friends, I am able to keep a positive outlook on
								life. I am so grateful for their support and love.
